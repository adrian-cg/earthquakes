# Coding Assignment

Solution for the following coding assignment:

1. Create a web page that takes as input a city/location name.
2. This page should call the GeoNames Recent Earthquake WebService ( http://www.geonames.org/export/JSON-webservices.html#earthquakesJSON ) with a bounding box dictated by the city entered.
3. Plot the results on Google Map ( http://code.google.com/apis/maps ). Each marker on this map should display details of the earthquake plotted. Ten results should be plotted.

Bonus:

1. Create a list of the top 10 largest earthquakes in the world for the last 12 months. This should be displayed somewhere on the page.
